if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        p = SeatClient.NewClient("20170000000","0000000")
    except UserCredentialError as e:
        print("pwd not matched.")

        print(">>>ç³»ç»Ÿæ­£åœ¨ç»´æŠ¤")
```


## Functions
  * Automatic reserve seats
  * Finding seat your like by command 'python seatLocker.py seat' and generate a configuration variable for your seat.
  * You can develop your own script with the utility provided by seatLocker. You can follow the notes in seat/utility.py to get more details.

## Featues
  * Very stable. it has been runing on a vps (1C512M) for 200 days and not crash.
  * if your seat was reserved by others, it will start random reserving mode.
  * You can use seatutility to build your own script.

## Dependencies
  * Python 3.5+

## How to use 
  1. Download all resources from the repository.
  2. Type "python seatLocker.py seat" to choose one seat your like.
  3. Follow notes in seatLocker.py and modify the configuration variables to make it work.
  4. Just run "python seatLocker.py"
  > You can use crontab to make the script cycle execution.

## FAQ
   1. Another script which functions like this but reserving speed is faster. I want to make it to reserve seat more quickly, what should I do?
   > This script uses a time.sleep to control reserving speed. **on line 137 in seatLocker.py**, You will find a time.sleep(3). It means after doing instructions above, it will sleep 3 seconds. Just change it. like 'time.sleep(1)' it allows float number like 0.5, but I do not recommend you to do that because if the script does poll very fast the server will deny script's access for safety.  

## Logs

#### Automatic Reserving Script
 * 1.0.0 the script is finished.
